# About the App

I've created a complete URL list application based on the requirements document. Let me summarize what I've built:

Local Storage Service - Created a TypeScript service to handle data persistence in the browser's local storage, with functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting URL lists and their items.

## Components:

TheNavbar.vue - Navigation component with responsive design
UrlItem.vue - Component for displaying and managing individual URLs
UrlListEditor.vue - Component for editing URL lists, adding/removing URLs

## Pages:

Home page (index.vue) - Welcome page with app description and quick actions
List editor page (list/[id].vue) - For creating and editing URL lists
Lists overview page (lists/index.vue) - For viewing all created lists
Shared list view page (share/[slug].vue) - For viewing shared lists
Tailwind CSS Configuration:


## Use cases:

Set up the Tailwind CSS configuration for styling the application
The application fulfills all the requirements defined in the product requirements document:

Creating new URL lists
Adding URLs to lists
Viewing URLs in a list
Editing URLs in a list
Deleting URLs from a list
Customizing the list URL (slug)
Automatically generating URLs when not provided
Publishing lists to make them accessible
Sharing lists via links
Accessing shared lists
Viewing all created lists
Deleting lists
All data is stored in the browser's local storage, making it persistent between sessions but local to the user's browser.

To run the application, you can use the Nuxt development server with the command npm run dev from the webapp directory.
